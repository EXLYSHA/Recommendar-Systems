       " 'Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles   Baby This colorful car collection develops motor skills and hand-eye coordination while your child makes important discoveries about sorting and strategy. There are four vehicles, numbered 1 through 4, of graduated  sizes: a rattling green sports car, a blue police car with a revolving roof light, a yellow school bus with an opening sunroof, and a red fire truck with an adjustable clicking ladder. The vehicles can be rolled  across the floor, and then stacked--ever so carefully--atop each other, and finally all nested inside the fire truck. Vehicles only nest or stack completely when arranged in proper order of size and number. Made of sturdy plastic, these toys can be dipped in warm sudsy water for easy cleaning.--Kathryn Gustafson',\n",
       " 'My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children   Baby This darling cloth book offers hands-on experience in recognizing shapes,  telling time, buttoning, buckling, snapping, lacing, distinguishing textures, and zipping.  The soft red book measures 8 inches and has a sturdy red zipper around three sides,  with soft stuffed handles on top. Three bright balloons and \"My Quiet Book\" are  embroidered on the front. Inside are four stiff white fabric-covered pages featuring  eight different activities. There are quilted shapes in primary colors with Velcro  attachments, a clock with movable hands, pastel quilted flowers that button onto their  stems, and bright quilted balloons that snap onto their strings. There\\'s a buckle to thread  on a pair of denim shorts, white laces to secure a red and yellow tennis shoe, bright  squares of differently textured fabrics for touching, and a zipper to fasten a floral dress.  Each page is lovingly finished and features a prominently placed embroidered skill title.  This book is great for skill learning at home and even better as a traveling companion!--Tami Horiuchi',\n",
       " \"The First Years Massaging Action Teether The First Years Baby In a relatively new concept in teething, The First Years  introduces this massaging action teether. The concept is really quite  simple: offer even the youngest infants a means to massage their gums  at will. The massaging action increases circulation, thereby helping to  alleviate swelling and discomfort. This soft, yellow, star-shaped  teether has a smiling face and three nubby points that vibrate when a  child bites down on them. The star sits upon an oversized blue plastic  handle that's easy for even the youngest child to grasp. There's also  an opening at the bottom of the handle that accepts a toy strap. The  star rattle is surface washable and is powered by a nonreplaceable  battery that's sealed inside the teether's handle for maximum safety.--Tami Horiuchi\",\n",
       " \"The First Years Soft Teething Beads The First Years Baby As is the case with pacifiers and bottles, different teethers  please different babies. Having the right one can make all the  difference in the world. These Soft Teething Beads are attached to a  yellow plastic claspless cord. Twelve knobby beads make up the teether  so it's long enough for a baby to grasp with both hands. The beads are  good and knobbly so babies will be able to fully work their gums, and  while holding the chain babies will inadvertently practice gross motor  skills by pulling their hands away from each other. When a baby is done  using this teether it'll make a perfect necklace for dolls or a  counting and color toy.--Sandy Hirsch\",\n",
       " 'Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim   Baby Wear your baby?! Dr. William Sears, noted pediatrician and  author (with his wife Martha, a registered nurse) of child-care books,  includingThe Baby BookandParenting the Fussy Baby,  recommends it highly. His research reveals that parents who \"wear\" their  babies experience a deep bonding with them; babies cry less when comforted  by the close movement, touch, smell, and sound of a loved one; and such  babies spend more time in a state of \"quiet alertness,\" which is the optimal  state for learning. Designed by Dr. Sears to foster the physical and emotional  closeness of \"attachment parenting,\" the Babysling Cradle lets you carry your  baby (up to 20 pounds) in comfort and safety. The fabric sling with its  extra-padded elastic railing nestles baby in a natural position. Your  warmth and touch do the rest. Four positions (cradle, snuggle, kangaroo, and  hip straddle) accommodate baby and the situation--from nursing to shopping.  The Babysling Cradle comes with an instruction booklet.--Ava Natov',\n",

The colorful soft cloth main  bar is 15 inches long by 2 inches in diameter; Velcro bands allow for  easy positioning in front of your baby on almost any stroller, swing,  or infant seat. There are five activities, including a twirling bug, a  bumblebee atop a twisty plastic stalk, and a crunchy-sounding cloth  butterfly. The most distracting feature might be the removable,  dishwasher-safe snack cup in the center, which has a flip-up,  bug-decorated lid for hiding (or revealing) snacks.--Richard Farr',\n",
       " 'Baby Trend Diaper Champ   Baby When dealing with a young baby or squirming toddler at diaper changing time, the last thing you need is a diaper pail that requires two hands. The Diaper Champ helps eliminate hassle&#x97;and odor&#x97;by providing convenient one-hand operation for quick disposals.Even better is that this wondrous device takes regular garbage bags. There is no need to constantly buy brand name refills because the Champ can use the typical tall kitchen sack, plus grocery or most other plastic bags. Aside from the use of regular bags making it the economical choice, this feature also makes the Champ more flexible. While diapers will no doubt be the most thrown away item, this pail can also accommodate wipes, cotton swabs, tissues, and other baby essentials.Functionality is simple: drop a diaper (or other trash) into the pail&#x92;s top receptacle and flip the handle. To empty, just unlock the top and remove the bag. Standing about two feet high, the Diaper Champ&#x92;s capacity is on par or larger than many of its competitors, usually only requiring a bag change once a week.But the true test of any diaper pail is its smell control, right? Most moms we polled claimed the Champ the hands-down winner, and only a few had occasional escaped odors after 18+ months of use. Once toddlers have been introduced to solid foods using scented bags can help fight off any excess pail smell. Another great tip for keeping the Champ fresh is to quickly spray it down with a disinfectant when changing bags.']"
